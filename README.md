# User Management System

## Description

This project is a simple user management system in Python, which allows you to register, list, search, and remove users directly from memory (without a database).

## Features

- **Register new user:** The user inputs their name, email, and age. The system validates whether the age is a number.
- **List all users:** Displays all registered users.
- **Search user by name:** Allows you to search for a user by name and provides their information.
- **Remove user:** Deletes a user from the system.
- **Exit the program:** Ends the execution.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

In the terminal, run:
python main.py
Follow the instructions in the interactive menu.

## Code Structure

- **`display_menu()`**: Shows the options menu.
- **`main()`**: Controls the program flow.
