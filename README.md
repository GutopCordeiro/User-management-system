#Description
This project is a simple user management system in Python, which allows you to register, list, search, and remove users directly from memory (without a database).

##Features

List all users: Displays all registered users.

Search user by name: Allows you to search for a user by name and provides their information.

Remove user: Deletes a user from the system.

Exit the program: Ends the execution.

##How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
In the terminal, run: python main.py
Follow the instructions in the interactive menu.
